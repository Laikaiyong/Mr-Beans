Sensorial degradation in green coffee can represent significant financial losses for producers, traders, and roasters. Yet while a certain degree of degradation over time may be inevitable, the material of the coffee packaging can have a significant impact on the shelf life and quality of the beans.
Jute, high-barrier, vacuum: which is really best? How much of an impact does the material actually have on the beans? And how can we measure this? Let’s take a look.

Reviewing Green Coffee Packaging Materials
Some of the most common materials are burlap, permeable plastic, high-barrier plastic, and vacuum.
Burlap
A canvas made from natural fibres extracted from plants, jute or burlap is the most traditional material used for manufacturing coffee bags. It’s an eco-friendly option; the
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
says that it is “100% bio-degradable and recyclable and thus environmentally friendly.” It’s also durable and relatively affordable, being the
oldest coffee packaging material
to date.
However, it doesn’t provide protection against moisture or oxygen – two elements associated with poorer coffee quality and even defects such as mold. The bags are permeable.
Moreover, jute bags traditionally hold 60 kilos of coffee (or, in some countries, 70 kilos). Meanwhile, plastic big bags and container liners can store from 1 to more than 20 tons of green beans. Depending on the lot being stored or shipped, producers may decide to opt for larger and therefore more efficient storage options.
Plastic
Most commonly made of polyethylene or polypropylene, plastic storage options range from 60-kilo bags to big bags and container liners. The material is cheaper and more resistant to moistures and gases than jute but is still permeable.

High-Barrier
Professor Flávio Meira Borém is an agronomic engineer specialized in vegetable production. He has dedicated the past few years to studying coffee. He says that a high-barrier bag is “a pack with different compositions and structures which are capable of preventing gas and water exchanges between the inside and the atmosphere… It’s packaging with high impermeability.”
While more expensive than other types of packaging, a high-barrier bag is designed to maintain the coffee’s quality over time by preventing chemical reactions with moisture and oxygen. You can find high-barrier packaging in a range of sizes, including container liners.

Vacuum
When coffee is vacuum packed, it is also stored in impermeable plastic bags. Then, in addition to the hermetic isolation of the green coffee, a negative pressure is then created to remove all air.
It’s a common belief that multi-laminate vacuum-packing is the most effective way to preserve green coffee quality. However, with a considerably higher cost, this method is typically only used for samples or micro and nano lots of exceptional specialty coffees.

Defining Coffee Degradation
Coffee degradation is the chemical changes that result in reduced flavors and aromas in the beans, especially sweetness and acidity. Cupping by a professional Q grader according to
SCA protocols
remains the most common way to measure coffee quality. Yet there are other ways to track degradation.
Some of these focus not on the sensorial qualities you can notice when drinking the coffee but instead on the chemical composition of the beans and how that relates to their cup profiles. While this is a relatively new field, these studies allow us to better understand degradation even before it becomes evident to the human tongue and nose. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Raman spectrometry are two methods used for this.
Giselle Figueiredo Abreu is an agricultural engineer and the author of “Raman spectroscopy: A new strategy for monitoring the quality of green coffee beans during storage,” which she published as part of her post-graduate work, overseen by Prof. Borém.
Abreu crossed-referenced sensorial reports from Q Graders with the results from Raman spectroscopy, and used this to analyze green coffee stored in permeable and impermeable packaging over time.
The coffee samples were of natural and pulped natural coffees cupping at over 84 points. Three types of 30-kilo containers were used: permeable paper packaging without a barrier, paper packaging with an impermeable high-barrier plastic bag inside, and vacuum packaging. The coffees were analyzed every three months for 18 months.

The Impact of Bag Material, 0–6 Months
According to Prof. Borém, in the first six months, the Q graders weren’t able to identify significant differences in the cupping scores for either naturals or pulped naturals, regardless of the choice of packaging. He says, “Cuppers have a very small likelihood of detecting sensorial differences in specialty coffee in the first 6 months. The possibility is very small, the differences are slight.”
But he stresses that the chemical composition was visible at both three months and six months, when they used both NMR and Raman spectrometry, for samples stored in permeable bags. Samples stored in impermeable bags, however, did not have visible evidence of any chemical changes.
“We were able to prove that the chemical composition of coffee begins to change early on, and this change will only be noticed by the cuppers after six months of storage,” he explains.
“This change is irreversible,” he stresses.
Recommendations
Although cupping scores might not show a difference between permeable packaging, such as jute bags, and impermeable high-barrier packaging, it’s clear that the beans are already beginning to degrade.
Leandro Martinoto is P&D Manager at
Videplast
, a packaging manufacturer with a focus on specialty and
fine coffees
. He tells me, “We recommend that after processing, coffee should be stored in multi-laminated high-barrier structures. These can be big bags, regular sacks, or liners.”
Prof. Borém also recommends that for specialty naturals and pulped naturals, “after the resting period… this coffee should already immediately be protected with a high-barrier bag.”
Within the warehouse, big bags and high-barrier liners will help conserve space and reduce costs. For smaller lots and for transportation, high-barrier bags are preferable to jute bags.

The Impact of Coffee Bag Material, 6–18 Months
After six months, cupping scores for coffee stored in permeable packaging started to fall. Prof. Borém says, “The sensory difference is already striking.”
He points to a pulped natural coffee originally cupped at 85–86 points and stored in permeable packaging. At nine months, it was cupping below 80 and considered commodity coffee. After 18 months, the coffee fell to below 75. In contrast, in the impermeable bags, it was still cupping at 83–84 points a year later, before dropping to 82 points after 18 months.
As for the different types of permeable packaging – high-barrier and vacuum-packing – the study only found negligible differences.
Unlike in the first six months, processing had a significant impact at this stage. Prof. Borém tells me, “These changes were more evident in the natural coffee than in the pulped natural.”
Recommendations
While it’s recommendable that specialty coffee is stored in impermeable bags straight after storage (the same applies for fine cup coffees), after six months, it becomes imperative. This is particularly true for coffees dried with some or all of the fruit still attached to them. Naturals are particularly vulnerable to degradation.
It is also worth remembering that the study was based on coffees in a stable environment. Coffees being transported, especially those going overseas, may be exposed to greater degrees of humidity. They will be at higher risk of degradation without the protection given by impermeable packaging. Container liners may also help to mitigate this risk.

When it comes to specialty coffee, preserving the beans’ quality for as long as possible is essential. Doing so can protect the value of the coffee as well as the business relationships formed between producers, traders, and roasters. Paying attention to bag material, especially for natural and pulped natural coffees, can significantly reduce bean degradation over time.

Conclusion
Understanding the Coffee Supply Chain
The coffee industry is a complex and intricate network of processes that spans multiple regions and involves numerous stakeholders. To appreciate the journey of a cup of coffee from farm to consumer, it is essential to understand the coffee supply chain. This encompasses the various stages involved in bringing coffee beans from the hands of farmers to the shelves of coffee shops and homes worldwide.
The coffee supply chain begins with coffee cultivation, predominantly in regions known as coffee belts, such as Central and South America, Africa, and Asia. Smallholder farmers, often working in cooperatives, grow coffee plants and carefully nurture them to produce high-quality cherries. Once the coffee cherries have ripened, they are harvested and undergo processing.
After processing, the coffee beans need to be sorted, graded, and prepared for export. This involves removing any defects or impurities, categorizing the beans based on size and quality, and packaging them appropriately. Coffee grading systems, such as the
Specialty Coffee Association’s (SCA)
protocol, help determine the quality and value of the beans.
Once the coffee is ready for export, it enters the international trade market. Exporters and importers play a vital role in facilitating the movement of coffee between producing and consuming countries. They handle logistics, negotiate contracts, arrange shipping, and navigate customs procedures to ensure the smooth flow of coffee across borders.
Upon arrival in the destination country, coffee undergoes further processing, including roasting, grinding, and packaging, before it reaches consumers through various channels like coffee shops, supermarkets, or online retailers. This final stage of the supply chain involves the efforts of roasters, distributors, wholesalers, and retailers to bring the coffee to market.
Understanding the coffee supply chain is crucial for all stakeholders involved, as it allows for better decision-making, quality control, and sustainability practices. By appreciating the complexities and challenges at each stage, coffee businesses can forge stronger partnerships, ensure transparency, and ultimately deliver an exceptional coffee experience to consumers worldwide.
Packaging and Storage of Coffee
Packaging
and storage play a crucial role in maintaining the quality and freshness of coffee beans throughout the supply chain. Proper packaging not only protects the beans from external factors but also helps preserve their aroma, flavor, and overall quality. Additionally, appropriate storage conditions are essential to prevent degradation and ensure that the coffee reaches consumers in optimal condition.
When it comes to packaging coffee, there are several factors to consider. Firstly, the packaging material should provide a barrier against oxygen, moisture, light, and odors, as these elements can deteriorate the coffee’s flavor and aroma. Common packaging materials include foil-lined bags, vacuum-sealed pouches, or cans with airtight seals. These materials help create a protective environment, shielding the beans from external influences.
Furthermore, the packaging design should facilitate easy handling, storage, and transportation. It is important to consider the size and shape of the package to optimize space utilization and minimize damage during shipping. Additionally, clear labeling with information such as origin, roast date, and brewing instructions can help consumers make informed choices and enjoy the coffee to its fullest potential.
In terms of storage, coffee beans should be kept in a cool, dry, and dark environment. Exposure to heat, humidity, and sunlight can accelerate the deterioration process and negatively impact the flavor and quality of the beans. Ideally, coffee should be stored in airtight containers away from direct sunlight, heat sources, and strong odors, as coffee beans are highly absorbent and can easily pick up undesirable flavors and aromas.
Moreover, it is important to avoid excessive temperature fluctuations, as this can cause condensation inside the packaging and compromise the coffee’s freshness. For larger quantities of coffee, it may be beneficial to store the beans in smaller, airtight containers to minimize exposure to air and maintain freshness.
By paying attention to packaging and storage practices, coffee businesses and consumers can enjoy the full potential of the beans, savoring the unique flavors and aromas that make each cup of coffee a delightful experience.
International Shipping Methods for Coffee

courier services
provide fast and reliable shipping for smaller coffee shipments. This method is suitable for time-sensitive deliveries or smaller orders. Express courier services usually offer
door-to-door
delivery with tracking capabilities, ensuring greater visibility and security for the shipment. However, it may be costlier compared to other methods, especially for larger volumes.
Intermodal Shipping:
Intermodal shipping combines different modes of transportation, such as utilizing both ocean and rail or trucking services. This method can offer a balance between cost-effectiveness and quicker transit times, depending on the specific routes and distances involved. Intermodal shipping provides flexibility and can be tailored to meet the unique needs of coffee shipments.
When selecting an international shipping method for coffee, it is essential to consider factors such as budget, volume, destination, and delivery requirements. It is also crucial to work with experienced freight forwarders or shipping agents who specialize in coffee logistics. These professionals can provide guidance on the most suitable shipping method, handle documentation, navigate customs procedures, and ensure compliance with international regulations.
By carefully evaluating the available shipping options and partnering with the right logistics experts, coffee businesses can effectively transport their products worldwide, maintaining the quality, freshness, and integrity of the beans throughout the shipping process.
Exporting and Importing Coffee
Exporting and importing coffee is a crucial part of the global coffee supply chain, connecting coffee-producing regions with coffee-consuming markets around the world. The process involves various steps, documentation, and considerations to ensure the smooth and efficient movement of coffee across borders. Here is an overview of exporting and importing coffee:

Coffee's distinctive edge: Why it's not just another food product
The best coffee packaging solutions for fresh coffee
Beans on the move: Optimising coffee delivery for peak freshness
Inspiration station: coffee brands crushing the packaging game
What's the best coffee packaging for me?
Ah, coffee.
Nothing beats that first sip of fresh coffee in the morning.
The comforting aroma. The warmth of the mug. A taste that awakens your senses.
​​Just picture it: steam rising from a freshly poured cup. The rich smell fills the air. And then that first indulgent sip.
It's a cherished ritual for many. And an essential part of the day for countless Europeans. In fact, Europe is the world's largest coffee market. This coffee-loving continent made up
32%
of global coffee consumption in 2021.
But there's nothing worse than going in for that first sip of nirvana only for your coffee to taste old. Stale. Flavorless. Instantly your day is off to a bad start. And the aftermath? A disappointed customer who'll likely never buy from that same coffee brand again.
So how can you prevent the dreaded fate of stale coffee?
It all comes down to ‌proper
coffee packaging
. From harvest to first sip, you'll guarantee the best quality coffee encased in your branding.
In this article, you'll learn:
Factors that play a pivotal role in preserving coffee's freshness.
The best coffee packaging solutions on the market.
How to streamline the coffee delivery process.
Coffee bag design inspiration from top brands.
Coffee's distinctive edge: Why it's not just another food product
Shipping food is a complicated process. You must find the proper packaging to keep it fresh and preserve the flavour. But coffee takes this requirement to another level.
Think of it this way. You can package a loaf of bread in a clear plastic bag, add a twist tie and call it a day. Coffee, on the other hand is not that simple. If you walk down the coffee aisle, you'll see:
Opaque, vacuum-sealed bags
Whole bean vs. ground coffee
Degassing valves and seals
Airtight coffee tins
Why? At its core,
coffee is a symphony of flavours and aromas
. But what grants it its rich character and flavour profile makes it challenging to preserve.
Let's break down the main factors that keep coffee fresh.
Oxygen: The silent flavour thief
Freshly roasted coffee beans are a treasure trove of flavours. However, expose them to oxygen, and you'll witness a slow, heartbreaking fade of those intricate notes.
In other words,
oxidation is coffee's natural enemy
. It turns those flavourful beans stale, flat, and lifeless.
Moisture: The coffee bean's bane
Moisture and coffee have a love-hate relationship. While coffee beans require (a lot of) moisture in the growing process, it becomes an enemy immediately after roasting.
Moisture can compromise the bean's integrity
. It leads to mould, off-flavours, and shorter shelf life.
Light: more foe than friend
Like our skin, coffee beans are sensitive to light. Prolonged exposure can break down the essential oils that give coffee its distinctive flavour.
Enter the unsung hero: coffee packaging.
Your packing is more than a vessel to hold the beans.
Coffee packaging
acts as a fortress. It shields your beloved brew from the elements.
It guarantees that every sip resonates with the rich flavours and aromas that coffee aficionados cherish.
Source
The packaging might seem like one of the final steps in the ‌grand scheme of your coffee's journey from the farm to the cup. But this last line of defence determines whether your morning brew is a fresh revelation or a flat disappointment.
Remember, coffee isn't just another food product. It's an experience. It's a lifestyle. And preserving that experience demands respect, knowledge, and the right packaging.
Take note that another essential part of the importance of packaging is how customers feel when they see it. Once it reaches the last stage of becoming a coffee product, ensure that you have an
effective coffee shop logo
that expresses the quality of your efforts.
Packaging is also the perfect place to
show off your brand's personality
. More on that later.
The best coffee packaging solutions for fresh coffee
Here are the
best coffee packing solutions
to preserve your finest roast.
Good: doypacks with resealable zippers
Doypacks are a favourite for a reason. Their resealable zippers make accessing your coffee convenient once opened. And it provides a tight seal to keep out unwanted elements.
This straightforward solution is a popular choice for coffee brands. Especially
recyclable paper doypacks
are cost-effective and do a good job of keeping your coffee fresh. The
flat bottoms are ideal for displaying coffee
on retail store shelves or in your customers' pantry.
And that's also why you'll often find this packaging in most local coffee shops and roasteries.
Better: vacuum-sealed bags and tins
Want to extend your coffee's shelf life? Look no further than vacuum-sealed bags and tins.
By removing air from the equation, vacuum-sealed packaging helps maintain your coffee's freshness for longer periods. The result? A consistent flavour with each brew.
Tins and cans are a popular choice for craft roasteries
. They're unique. They block out unwanted light. And they provide some of the best airtight seals. So if you want to
stand out from the masses
, a
custom can
design is a solid option.
Williams Sonoma
, an American gourmet food and cookware brand, packages its coffee the same day it's roasted. Then it vacuum-packs the coffee beans in tins to ensure optimal freshness.
Better yet, this coffee bean packaging stands out from the rest of the bags on the shelves. And their beans are less likely to face damage during shipping.
Best: degassing valves
Freshly roasted coffee beans release carbon dioxide. Without an outlet, this could compromise the package and the bean quality.
Degassing valves solve this problem by letting the gas out without allowing external air inside the bag.
And although this sounds like a wild machine, it's quite the opposite. It's so small that most people don't realize it's a core part of a coffee bag.
It looks like a small button. Sometimes, it's called an
aroma valve
or coffee valve b
ecause you can smell the coffee's unique aroma through the valve.
Hawaii is the most isolated population centre in the world. They know a thing or two about protecting the freshness of their 100% Kona coffee during transit.
Mountain Thunder Coffee Plantation
says coffee lovers should never buy a bag of coffee without a degassing valve. Why?
Degassing valves are the key components to preserving coffee flavours and freshness.
Whole coffee beans maintain their freshness for up to 12 months when stored in:
Nitrogen-flushed bags with a one-way valve
A basic
pouch equipped with a degassing valve
Nitrogen flushing swaps out oxygen in food packaging for nitrogen. This method preserves food quality, as nitrogen remains neutral. It doesn't affect texture, flavour, or taste.
Nitrogen forms a protective barrier around products during transport and shelf storage.
Conversely, vacuum sealing simply extracts all the air from the package before sealing. It doesn't introduce any gasses. The takeaway? Nitrogen flushing is a superior method for packaging coffee over vacuum sealing.
Sustainable packaging: biodegradable and compostable bags
Today, customers are increasingly eco-conscious. They actively seek out retailers who align with their values. And recent data support this claim, with
82%
of consumers willing to pay more for sustainable packaging.
Biodegradable and compostable bags
are a quality sustainable packaging solution
for an eco-conscious consumer base.
Compostable doypacks with resealable zipper
When you pick these
eco-friendly options
, you're preserving the quality of your product. And you build a brand image that resonates with consumers — protecting our planet.
A sustainable choice today can lead to increased customer loyalty tomorrow.
Keep this in mind as you navigate your coffee packaging decisions.
Consistent coffee packaging
When you piece together a hodge podge of various packaging solutions, chances are your
branding is not going to be consistent
.
That's why looking for a single
coffee packaging supplier
is worth going the extra mile.
Whether you're a
coffee subscription service
or a basic coffee shop,
you want your packaging to be uniform and representative.
In order to verify the quality of your supplier's packaging, order samples of your
printed mailer boxes
,
resealable pouches,
custom labels
, or anything else you might need.
Try out the materials. Compare the vividness of the print. That's how you know all the pieces together create a cohesive whole.
Ordering a consistent coffee packaging set from a single supplier can:
Enhance the
unboxing experience
.
Elevate your brand's perception.
Simplify the shipping process and reduce your carbon footprint.
Pro tip:
Use mailer boxes for convenience and protection of your coffee pouches and cans
. With sturdy exterior boxes to protect the beans, your coffee will reach its destination in optimal condition.
The result? The best cup of coffee. And happy customers.
Beans on the move: Optimising coffee delivery for peak freshness
With ‌proper packaging (and storage), you can increase the shelf life of your coffee. Here's a quick and fast guide:
Ground coffee in an unopened bag:
2–4 months
Roasted whole coffee beans in a vacuum-sealed bag:
3–5 months
Whole coffee beans in an airtight container:
12 months
That's great, right? You have a decent amount of time to get your coffee into the hands of your consumers. But coffee enthusiasts want the best of the best. They want coffee a few days after it's roasted.
While the type of coffee packaging you choose is important, so is the shipping process. Let's dive into how to make that more efficient.
1. Streamline your entire supply chain process
From harvesting to shipping, there are many moving parts in the coffee supply chain. And any serious kinks can impact your ability to deliver the highest quality coffee.
Start by evaluating your current suppliers.
Are they reliable and timely?
Are there any bottlenecks in procurement?
Invest in the proper
supply chain analytics
tools to help you uncover your problem areas. You can access real-time insights into inventory levels, on-time delivery metrics, and order costs.
For example,
‌asset tracking software
allows you to check the location and condition of coffee shipments at any given moment.
That's right.
You can trace coffee packages from origin to destination.
These insights help identify potential issues or delays in real-time. That way, you can take prompt corrective actions as needed.
So wave goodbye to supply chain mishaps with increased transparency and hello to coffee that stays fresh and delicious. Oh, and don't forget about the potential cost savings.
2. Find the right delivery partner
Next, it's time to focus on logistics. The goal?
Optimise routes for efficient deliveries
. That way, the journey from your packing facility to the store shelves (or customer's doorstep) is as direct as possible.
Collaborate with transportation partners who prioritise punctuality and care in handling your products. Using an
express courier service
that offers same-day delivery reduces transit time. You can guarantee that your coffee is always fresh upon arrival.
And the best part?
According to
research from GoPeople
,
88% of customers are willing to pay for same-day delivery. It makes them more likely to shop online.
With the right delivery partner, your biggest coffee fans get the freshest batch every time.
The higher price tag for same-day delivery doesn't dent your margins. And you build a competitive edge. It's a win-win.

Packaging Beans,"4 Factors to Consider When Selecting Coffee Packaging
Danielle Ohl
April 17, 2018
Your coffee packaging is your brand ambassador, a communicator of your company values, and what keeps your coffee fresh. It is a vital piece of your marketing and ensures the quality of your product on its journey to reach your loyal consumers. So don't treat it as an afterthought; give your coffee packaging the attention it rightfully deserves!

to uncover hidden inefficiencies that could be killing your business >>
Here are 4 factors to consider:
1. Types of coffee packaging bags
As you look at store shelves in the coffee section, you will likely see 5 main types of coffee packaging bags, shown below:
Flat Bottom Bag
The
flat bottom coffee bag
is one of the most popular packaging formats in the coffee industry. It features a prominent shelf presence and is able to stand unassisted for maximum impact. Often the top of the bag is folded over or completely down into a brick shape and sealed.
Read about how ""Death Wish Coffee"" uses VFFS packaging automation to create their iconic coffee bags >>
Quad Seal Bag
A
quad seal bag
is also very popular in the coffee industry. This bag has crisp side seals, can stand unassisted, and is attention-grabbing for its modular look. This coffee packaging bag type holds its shape very well and can support heavier fills of coffee. The quad seal bag usually is more costly than other bag styles.
Pillow Bag
The most economical and simplistic bag type, the
pillow bag
is often used for fractional, single-serve coffee packaging formats. This bag style lays flat for display purposes. The pillow bag is by far the least costly to produce.
Bag-in-Bag (BIB)
Fractional packs of coffee can be packaged
bag-in-bag
into a larger package for foodservice or bulk sale purposes. Modern coffee packaging machines can form, fill, and seal the smaller frac packs and subsequently package those into a larger outer wrap on a single
bag-in-bag machine
.
Doypack
With a flat top and a rounded, oval-shaped bottom, the
Doypack
or stand-up pouch differentiates itself from more typical coffee package types. It gives the consumer an impression of a premium, small-batch product. Often fitted with zippers, this coffee packaging bag type is beloved by consumers for its convenience. This bag style usually costs more than other more simple bag types.
While stand-up pouches can be created on form fill seal machines, they are much better looking when purchased premade, and then filled and sealed on an
automatic pouch packing machine
.

2. Coffee freshness factors
Will your product be distributed to stores, cafes, businesses, or shipped to end-users nation- or worldwide? If so, your coffee will need to stay fresh until the very end. To accomplish this,
Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP)
options can be used.
The most popular modified atmosphere packaging system is
ONE-WAY DEGASSING VALVES
, which allow the natural build-up of carbon dioxide in freshly roasted coffee an escape route while not letting
COFFEE FRESHNESS KILLERS
like oxygen, moisture, or light inside the bag.
Other modified atmosphere packaging options include nitrogen gas flushing, which displaces oxygen in the coffee bag before filling, and use of high-barrier packaging materials. You can choose to use one type of MAP in your coffee bean packaging design or many, depending upon your needs. For most modern coffee packaging applications, all of the above are recommended.
3. Coffee packaging convenience options
With a busy consumer base that values their time above all,
CONVENIENCE PACKAGING
is all the rage in the coffee market.
Coffee roasters should consider the following options when catering to modern customers:
Modern consumers are less brand loyal than ever before and seek to purchase smaller, trial-sized packages of coffee as they explore their options.
Click to Tweet
Zippers
One of the most popular recloseable options, zippers mean a consumer can reuse the product after opening. Zipper reclosures provide an effective barrier against staling.
Ties or tape
Popular in the coffee industry are tin tie and tape down closures. These reclosable options can be employed either independently or together on your coffee bean packaging machine. This choice is not as airtight as a zipper but is still a popular look for stand-up coffee packaging bags.
Clear labeling
The Perfect Daily Grind attests that ""you need a good label to communicate the origin(s), processing method, [and] roast date...of your beans."" Customers want the whole story, in plain language, in plain sight.
Minimal package design
Consumers are already overwhelmed with choices, visuals, and data. Make it easy for them to select your coffee with minimal use of graphics and bold, solid patterns in your coffee bag packaging design.
'Try me' package sizes
Bulk packages of coffee still have their place in the market, don't get us wrong. But modern consumers are less brand loyal than ever before, and they want to purchase smaller, trial sized packages of coffee as they explore their options.
4. Coffee packaging process
Will you be hand-filling your coffee bags or are you considering automating with
COFFEE PACKAGING EQUIPMENT
? If you plan to hand-fill your coffee bags, The Perfect Daily Grind recommends you choose a bag style that has a wide enough top opening to accommodate your scoop or filling apparatus. The Doypack may not be ideal in this situation as it only has two corners at its top opening, limiting the amount of room available for a filling tool. Compare this with the quad seal or flat bottom bag, which usually have four corners at their top openings and much more room to accommodate filling tools.
Also note that hand-packing, while it may have a lower cost to entry, seriously limits your throughput, accuracy, and ability to ramp up production on a moment's notice. If you already use - or are considering purchasing - automated
COFFEE BAGGING EQUIPMENT
, your bag options are almost unlimited.
Most modern coffee packing machines can easily accommodate multiple bag styles and sizes. Fill weights are no longer a worry as automated filling solutions can operate at a high level of accuracy. Your throughput can increase by leaps and bounds and if you suddenly receive a large order, scaling your production up is no biggie.

Shipping Coffee
Coffee is one of the largest commodity markets in the world, with the morning pick-me-up of many coming in second next to oil! Every year, 7 billion kgs of coffee are traded, and 133 million bags are exported, creating a 28 billion dollar market. The global coffee market was valued at over 88 billion dollars in 2023, with the growth forecast predicting a 4.6% rise every year until 2028. Coffee consumption and the demand for specialty and exotic coffee continue to rise. This increase in demand prompts the need for reliable and efficient shipping methods. Shipping coffee globally presents many opportunities for growth and expansion.
Shipping Methods
Choosing the right shipping method for coffee beans is crucial, and various factors come into play, such as cost, transit time, destination, volume, and any specific requirements for maintaining the coffee’s quality during transit.
Air freight
is ideal for time-sensitive shipments, ensuring fast transit to preserve the coffee’s freshness. Often suitable for smaller quantities.
Ground freight
suits smaller quantities and shorter distances, providing a cost-effective solution. Ocean freight, while slower, is the most economical for large volumes, allowing beans to undergo a natural maturation process that enhances flavor.
Ocean freight
is the cheapest option, allowing collaboration with others heading to the same destination and regulating temperature in full containers.
Cargo ships commonly transport coffee beans, whether packed in Full Container Load (FCL) or Less than Container Load (LCL).
A potential option for specialty roasters or farmers is a refrigerated container to help control temperature and moisture levels.
Express courier services
are excellent for time-sensitive and small orders, providing door-to-door delivery with tracking abilities. Specialty roasters or farmers may consider refrigerated containers for temperature and moisture control.
Mastering the intricacies of the shipping process is essential to ensure coffee beans reach their destination with aroma, flavor, and quality intact, from meticulous packaging to strategic transportation.
At
FreightCenter
, our industry expertise, extensive carrier network, comprehensive logistics support, and commitment to the safe transportation of coffee make us the ideal company to trust for shipping coffee. Our dedication to customer satisfaction and efficient delivery aligns perfectly with the industry’s unique requirements.
