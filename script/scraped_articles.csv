Packaging Beans,"Share Twitter Facebook Pocket LinkedIn Sensorial degradation in green coffee can represent significant financial losses for producers, traders, and roasters. Yet while a certain degree of degradation over time may be inevitable, the material of the coffee packaging can have a significant impact on the shelf life and quality of the beans. Jute, highbarrier, vacuum which is really best? How much of an impact does the material actually have on the beans? And how can we measure this? Lets take a look.

Credit Ivan Petrich Reviewing Green Coffee Packaging Materials Some of the most common materials are burlap, permeable plastic, highbarrier plastic, and vacuum. Burlap A canvas made from natural fibres extracted from plants, jute or burlap is the most traditional material used for manufacturing coffee bags. Its an ecofriendly option the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations says that it is 100 biodegradable and recyclable and thus environmentally friendly. Its also durable and relatively affordable, being the oldest coffee packaging material to date. However, it doesnt provide protection against moisture or oxygen  two elements associated with poorer coffee quality and even defects such as mold. The bags are permeable. Moreover, jute bags traditionally hold 60 kilos of coffee or, in some countries, 70 kilos. Meanwhile, plastic big bags and container liners can store from 1 to more than 20 tons of green beans. Depending on the lot being stored or shipped, producers may decide to opt for larger and therefore more efficient storage options. Plastic Most commonly made of polyethylene or polypropylene, plastic storage options range from 60kilo bags to big bags and container liners. The material is cheaper and more resistant to moistures and gases than jute but is still permeable.

He says that a highbarrier bag is a pack with different compositions and structures which are capable of preventing gas and water exchanges between the inside and the atmosphere Its packaging with high impermeability. While more expensive than other types of packaging, a highbarrier bag is designed to maintain the coffees quality over time by preventing chemical reactions with moisture and oxygen. You can find highbarrier packaging in a range of sizes, including container liners. Highbarrier Videplast bags in use at Fazenda Klem. Credit Nicholas Yamada Vacuum When coffee is vacuum packed, it is also stored in impermeable plastic bags. Then, in addition to the hermetic isolation of the green coffee, a negative pressure is then created to remove all air. Its a common belief that multilaminate vacuumpacking is the most effective way to preserve green coffee quality. However, with a considerably higher cost, this method is typically only used for samples or micro and nano lots of exceptional specialty coffees. Vacuumpacked green coffee samples. Credit Ivan Petrich Defining Coffee Degradation Coffee degradation is the chemical changes that result in reduced flavors and aromas in the beans, especially sweetness and acidity. Cupping by a professional Q grader according to SCA protocols remains the most common way to measure coffee quality. Yet there are other ways to track degradation. Some of these focus not on the sensorial qualities you can notice when drinking the coffee but instead on the chemical composition of the beans and how that relates to their cup profiles. While this is a relatively new field, these studies allow us to better understand degradation even before it becomes evident to the human tongue and nose. Nuclear magnetic resonance NMR and Raman spectrometry are two methods used for this. Giselle Figueiredo Abreu is an agricultural engineer and the author of Raman spectroscopy A new strategy for monitoring the quality of green coffee beans during storage, which she published as part of her postgraduate work, overseen by Prof. Borém. Abreu crossedreferenced sensorial reports from Q Graders with the results from Raman spectroscopy, and used this to analyze green coffee stored in permeable and impermeable packaging over time. The coffee samples were of natural and pulped natural coffees cupping at over 84 points. Three types of 30kilo containers were used permeable paper packaging without a barrier, paper packaging with an impermeable highbarrier plastic bag inside, and vacuum packaging. The coffees were analyzed every three months for 18 months. A highbarrier big bag developed to hold up to 1,200 kilos. Credit Videplast The Impact of Bag Material, 06 Months According to Prof. Borém, in the first six months, the Q graders werent able to identify significant differences in the cupping scores for either naturals or pulped naturals, regardless of the choice of packaging. He says, Cuppers have a very small likelihood of detecting sensorial differences in specialty coffee in the first 6 months. The possibility is very small, the differences are slight. But he stresses that the chemical composition was visible at both three months and six months, when they used both NMR and Raman spectrometry, for samples stored in permeable bags. Samples stored in impermeable bags, however, did not have visible evidence of any chemical changes. We were able to prove that the chemical composition of coffee begins to change early on, and this change will only be noticed by the cuppers after six months of storage, he explains. This change is irreversible, he stresses. Recommendations Although cupping scores might not show a difference between permeable packaging, such as jute bags, and impermeable highbarrier packaging, its clear that the beans are already beginning to degrade. Leandro Martinoto is PD Manager at Videplast , a packaging manufacturer with a focus on specialty and fine coffees . He tells me, We recommend that after processing, coffee should be stored in multilaminated highbarrier structures. These can be big bags, regular sacks, or liners. Prof. Borém also recommends that for specialty naturals and pulped naturals, after the resting period this coffee should already immediately be protected with a highbarrier bag. Within the warehouse, big bags and highbarrier liners will help conserve space and reduce costs. For smaller lots and for transportation, highbarrier bags are preferable to jute bags.

Credit Nicholas Yamada The Impact of Coffee Bag Material, 618 Months After six months, cupping scores for coffee stored in permeable packaging started to fall. Prof. Borém says, The sensory difference is already striking. He points to a pulped natural coffee originally cupped at 8586 points and stored in permeable packaging. At nine months, it was cupping below 80 and considered commodity coffee. After 18 months, the coffee fell to below 75. In contrast, in the impermeable bags, it was still cupping at 8384 points a year later, before dropping to 82 points after 18 months. As for the different types of permeable packaging  highbarrier and vacuumpacking  the study only found negligible differences. Unlike in the first six months, processing had a significant impact at this stage. Prof. Borém tells me, These changes were more evident in the natural coffee than in the pulped natural. Recommendations While its recommendable that specialty coffee is stored in impermeable bags straight after storage the same applies for fine cup coffees, after six months, it becomes imperative. This is particularly true for coffees dried with some or all of the fruit still attached to them. Naturals are particularly vulnerable to degradation. It is also worth remembering that the study was based on coffees in a stable environment. Coffees being transported, especially those going overseas, may be exposed to greater degrees of humidity. They will be at higher risk of degradation without the protection given by impermeable packaging. Container liners may also help to mitigate this risk.

Doing so can protect the value of the coffee as well as the business relationships formed between producers, traders, and roasters. Paying attention to bag material, especially for natural and pulped natural coffees, can significantly reduce bean degradation over time. Found this interesting?

Table of Contents Toggle Understanding the Coffee Supply Chain Packaging and Storage of Coffee International Shipping Methods for Coffee Exporting and Importing Coffee Challenges and Solutions in Shipping Coffee DFreights Expertise in Shipping Coffee Worldwide Conclusion Understanding the Coffee Supply Chain The coffee industry is a complex and intricate network of processes that spans multiple regions and involves numerous stakeholders. To appreciate the journey of a cup of coffee from farm to consumer, it is essential to understand the coffee supply chain. This encompasses the various stages involved in bringing coffee beans from the hands of farmers to the shelves of coffee shops and homes worldwide. The coffee supply chain begins with coffee cultivation, predominantly in regions known as coffee belts, such as Central and South America, Africa, and Asia. Smallholder farmers, often working in cooperatives, grow coffee plants and carefully nurture them to produce highquality cherries. Once the coffee cherries have ripened, they are harvested and undergo processing. After processing, the coffee beans need to be sorted, graded, and prepared for export. This involves removing any defects or impurities, categorizing the beans based on size and quality, and packaging them appropriately. Coffee grading systems, such as the Specialty Coffee Associations SCA protocol, help determine the quality and value of the beans. Once the coffee is ready for export, it enters the international trade market. Exporters and importers play a vital role in facilitating the movement of coffee between producing and consuming countries. They handle logistics, negotiate contracts, arrange shipping, and navigate customs procedures to ensure the smooth flow of coffee across borders. Upon arrival in the destination country, coffee undergoes further processing, including roasting, grinding, and packaging, before it reaches consumers through various channels like coffee shops, supermarkets, or online retailers. This final stage of the supply chain involves the efforts of roasters, distributors, wholesalers, and retailers to bring the coffee to market. Understanding the coffee supply chain is crucial for all stakeholders involved, as it allows for better decisionmaking, quality control, and sustainability practices. By appreciating the complexities and challenges at each stage, coffee businesses can forge stronger partnerships, ensure transparency, and ultimately deliver an exceptional coffee experience to consumers worldwide. Packaging and Storage of Coffee Packaging and storage play a crucial role in maintaining the quality and freshness of coffee beans throughout the supply chain. Proper packaging not only protects the beans from external factors but also helps preserve their aroma, flavor, and overall quality. Additionally, appropriate storage conditions are essential to prevent degradation and ensure that the coffee reaches consumers in optimal condition. When it comes to packaging coffee, there are several factors to consider. Firstly, the packaging material should provide a barrier against oxygen, moisture, light, and odors, as these elements can deteriorate the coffees flavor and aroma. Common packaging materials include foillined bags, vacuumsealed pouches, or cans with airtight seals. These materials help create a protective environment, shielding the beans from external influences. Furthermore, the packaging design should facilitate easy handling, storage, and transportation. It is important to consider the size and shape of the package to optimize space utilization and minimize damage during shipping. Additionally, clear labeling with information such as origin, roast date, and brewing instructions can help consumers make informed choices and enjoy the coffee to its fullest potential. In terms of storage, coffee beans should be kept in a cool, dry, and dark environment. Exposure to heat, humidity, and sunlight can accelerate the deterioration process and negatively impact the flavor and quality of the beans. Ideally, coffee should be stored in airtight containers away from direct sunlight, heat sources, and strong odors, as coffee beans are highly absorbent and can easily pick up undesirable flavors and aromas. Moreover, it is important to avoid excessive temperature fluctuations, as this can cause condensation inside the packaging and compromise the coffees freshness. For larger quantities of coffee, it may be beneficial to store the beans in smaller, airtight containers to minimize exposure to air and maintain freshness. By paying attention to packaging and storage practices, coffee businesses and consumers can enjoy the full potential of the beans, savoring the unique flavors and aromas that make each cup of coffee a delightful experience. International Shipping Methods for Coffee When it comes to shipping coffee worldwide, selecting the right shipping method is crucial to ensure the timely and safe delivery of coffee beans. There are several international shipping methods available, each with its own advantages and considerations.

Ah, coffee. Nothing beats that first sip of fresh coffee in the morning. The comforting aroma. The warmth of the mug. A taste that awakens your senses. Just picture it steam rising from a freshly poured cup. The rich smell fills the air. And then that first indulgent sip. Its a cherished ritual for many. And an essential part of the day for countless Europeans. In fact, Europe is the worlds largest coffee market. This coffeeloving continent made up 32 of global coffee consumption in 2021. But theres nothing worse than going in for that first sip of nirvana only for your coffee to taste old. Stale. Flavorless. Instantly your day is off to a bad start. And the aftermath? A disappointed customer wholl likely never buy from that same coffee brand again. So how can you prevent the dreaded fate of stale coffee? It all comes down to proper coffee packaging . From harvest to first sip, youll guarantee the best quality coffee encased in your branding. In this article, youll learn Factors that play a pivotal role in preserving coffees freshness. The best coffee packaging solutions on the market. How to streamline the coffee delivery process. Coffee bag design inspiration from top brands. Coffees distinctive edge Why its not just another food product Shipping food is a complicated process. You must find the proper packaging to keep it fresh and preserve the flavour. But coffee takes this requirement to another level. Think of it this way. You can package a loaf of bread in a clear plastic bag, add a twist tie and call it a day. Coffee, on the other hand is not that simple. If you walk down the coffee aisle, youll see Opaque, vacuumsealed bags Whole bean vs. ground coffee Degassing valves and seals Airtight coffee tins Why? At its core, coffee is a symphony of flavours and aromas . But what grants it its rich character and flavour profile makes it challenging to preserve. Lets break down the main factors that keep coffee fresh. Oxygen The silent flavour thief Freshly roasted coffee beans are a treasure trove of flavours. However, expose them to oxygen, and youll witness a slow, heartbreaking fade of those intricate notes. In other words, oxidation is coffees natural enemy . It turns those flavourful beans stale, flat, and lifeless. Moisture The coffee beans bane Moisture and coffee have a lovehate relationship. While coffee beans require a lot of moisture in the growing process, it becomes an enemy immediately after roasting. Moisture can compromise the beans integrity . It leads to mould, offflavours, and shorter shelf life. Light more foe than friend Like our skin, coffee beans are sensitive to light. Prolonged exposure can break down the essential oils that give coffee its distinctive flavour. Enter the unsung hero coffee packaging. Your packing is more than a vessel to hold the beans. Coffee packaging acts as a fortress. It shields your beloved brew from the elements. It guarantees that every sip resonates with the rich flavours and aromas that coffee aficionados cherish. Source The packaging might seem like one of the final steps in the grand scheme of your coffees journey from the farm to the cup. But this last line of defence determines whether your morning brew is a fresh revelation or a flat disappointment. Remember, coffee isnt just another food product. Its an experience. Its a lifestyle. And preserving that experience demands respect, knowledge, and the right packaging. Take note that another essential part of the importance of packaging is how customers feel when they see it. Once it reaches the last stage of becoming a coffee product, ensure that you have an effective coffee shop logo that expresses the quality of your efforts. Packaging is also the perfect place to show off your brands personality . More on that later. The best coffee packaging solutions for fresh coffee Here are the best coffee packing solutions to preserve your finest roast. Good doypacks with resealable zippers Doypacks are a favourite for a reason. Their resealable zippers make accessing your coffee convenient once opened. And it provides a tight seal to keep out unwanted elements. This straightforward solution is a popular choice for coffee brands. Especially recyclable paper doypacks are costeffective and do a good job of keeping your coffee fresh. The flat bottoms are ideal for displaying coffee on retail store shelves or in your customers pantry. And thats also why youll often find this packaging in most local coffee shops and roasteries. Better vacuumsealed bags and tins Want to extend your coffees shelf life? Look no further than vacuumsealed bags and tins. By removing air from the equation, vacuumsealed packaging helps maintain your coffees freshness for longer periods. The result? A consistent flavour with each brew. Tins and cans are a popular choice for craft roasteries . Theyre unique. They block out unwanted light. And they provide some of the best airtight seals. So if you want to stand out from the masses , a custom can design is a solid option. Williams Sonoma , an American gourmet food and cookware brand, packages its coffee the same day its roasted. Then it vacuumpacks the coffee beans in tins to ensure optimal freshness. Better yet, this coffee bean packaging stands out from the rest of the bags on the shelves. And their beans are less likely to face damage during shipping. Best degassing valves Freshly roasted coffee beans release carbon dioxide. Without an outlet, this could compromise the package and the bean quality. Degassing valves solve this problem by letting the gas out without allowing external air inside the bag. And although this sounds like a wild machine, its quite the opposite. Its so small that most people dont realize its a core part of a coffee bag. It looks like a small button. Sometimes, its called an aroma valve or coffee valve b ecause you can smell the coffees unique aroma through the valve. Hawaii is the most isolated population centre in the world. They know a thing or two about protecting the freshness of their 100 Kona coffee during transit. Mountain Thunder Coffee Plantation says coffee lovers should never buy a bag of coffee without a degassing valve. Why? Degassing valves are the key components to preserving coffee flavours and freshness. Whole coffee beans maintain their freshness for up to 12 months when stored in Nitrogenflushed bags with a oneway valve A basic pouch equipped with a degassing valve Nitrogen flushing swaps out oxygen in food packaging for nitrogen. This method preserves food quality, as nitrogen remains neutral. It doesnt affect texture, flavour, or taste. Nitrogen forms a protective barrier around products during transport and shelf storage. Conversely, vacuum sealing simply extracts all the air from the package before sealing. It doesnt introduce any gasses. The takeaway? Nitrogen flushing is a superior method for packaging coffee over vacuum sealing. Sustainable packaging biodegradable and compostable bags Today, customers are increasingly ecoconscious. They actively seek out retailers who align with their values. And recent data support this claim, with 82 of consumers willing to pay more for sustainable packaging. Biodegradable and compostable bags are a quality sustainable packaging solution for an ecoconscious consumer base.

Packaging Beans,"May 19, 2022 Ultimate Guide to Coffee Packaging Though its often underemphasized, packaging for coffee is very important. Without it, delicate beans quickly lose their flavor notes and deep, roasted blends lose the richness and depth of flavor theyre known for. Even the highest quality coffee beans wont stay that way for long without the right coffee packaging. In this post, well cover the different types of coffee packaging, exploring what makes each one worth considering. No post is complete without examples, so well close with a handful of coffee packaging designs from brands we think are doing it right. Why Coffee Packaging Matters Americans love their coffee. In fact, according to a recent survey from the National Coffee Association, seven out of ten of us drink at least one cup of coffee per week, with 63 downing that amount or more daily. With so many coffee connoisseurs out there, choosing the right coffee packaging is essential. In short, coffee packaging is the bag or carton that keeps coffee beans fresh. There are lots of environmental forces seeking to send fresh, highquality beans into mediocrity. Light, oxygen, and moisture all conspire against freshly roasted coffee. Coffee bean packaging helps to keep beans fresher for longer, allowing your customers to experience your products the way you intended. Types of Coffee Packaging There are quite a few coffee bag designs out there, each with its own unique set of benefits. Here are the main types of coffee packaging and how they work. Flat Bottom Bag One of the most popular types of coffee packaging, the flat bottom bag is true to its name. The bottom of the bag is flat, allowing it to stand up by itself. This makes it easy to display. Also known as a sidefold pouch, this coffee bag design typically features a simple, sealed top thats either pulled open or cut open by the consumer. A tin tie or tape closure makes the flat bottom bag easy to reseal between uses. Quad Seal Bag Visually similar to the flat bottom bag, the quad seal bag has a level bottom and is also able to stand upright while on display. But this design is different in some important ways. The quad seal bag features distinctive side seals that give it flattened, rather than rounded, sides. To many, this bag looks a bit higherend than the flat bottom bag, and it has a price tag to match in general, quad seal bags are more expensive than their flatbottomed brethren. Quad seal bags usually close via a tin tie or tape closure. Doypack Doypacks are common in a number of food packaging applications. Chances are you have at least one of these in your pantry right now. These flattopped, ovalbottomed packages seal on both sides, creating flat front and back panels. The top of the bag seals with zipper closure. Many consumers find Doypacks more convenient because they stand up easily and are simpler to close than other types of coffee packaging. Pillow Bags These are the most affordable of the coffee bag designs. Pillow bags are small bags sealed at the top and bottom. They lay flat, and are most often used in foodservice applications like corporate offices or restaurants. Pillow bags are usually packaged together in a baginbag package, which is a commonly used foodservice packaging to combine multiple, smaller pillow bags for bulk service. 5 Things To Consider When Choosing Packaging for Coffee Finding the right coffee bag design is just part of the equation. Here are other things to consider when settling on the best coffee bag design to house your beans. Degassing Valves Roasted coffee naturally emits carbon dioxide. Without a place to go, the quality of coffee can suffer. Coffee bags with a degassing valve provide an escape hatch for the CO2 while keeping oxygen from entering. Gas Flushing Oxygen is the archenemy of fresh coffee. Flushing the coffee package with an inert gas like nitrogen can displace most of the oxygen in the package, creating a largely oxygenfree environment that keeps it fresh for longer. Top Seals There are lots of ways to reseal coffee bags. The simplest, cheapest option is the tape closure. A tape closure is a sticky strip that vaguely resembles a robust piece of packaging tape. Its designed to be stuck and unstuck multiple times, keeping the resealed bag from opening once its been crimped shut. A close second in terms of simplicity and cost is the trusty tin tie. These inexpensive, flexible strips are designed to be bent around the bag to keep the top flap sealed after the bag has been opened. Zipper tapes are more expensive, but provide a better seal and are easier for many consumers to close. Environmental Sustainability Used coffee packaging will live on for many generations in a landfill. If youre targeting an ecoconscious demographic, the best coffee bag design may be one that wont still be there when their greatgreatgreatgrandchildren are drinking their favorite blends. Coffee bags made from biodegradable materials like husks or paper break down quickly, making them an earthfriendly packaging choice. Check out these ecofriendly packaging design ideas . Labels Many coffee connoisseurs want the details on their drink, including what region the coffee is from, the name of the farm or microlot it was sourced from, and what tasting notes can be expected. Coffee labels are an ideal medium for displaying this important information. A welldesigned coffee label can attract consumer attention and serve as valuable marketing collateral.

If you plan to handfill your coffee bags, The Perfect Daily Grind recommends you choose a bag style that has a wide enough top opening to accommodate your scoop or filling apparatus. The Doypack may not be ideal in this situation as it only has two corners at its top opening, limiting the amount of room available for a filling tool. Compare this with the quad seal or flat bottom bag, which usually have four corners at their top openings and much more room to accommodate filling tools.

Surrender of Licence 4.5 The licensee can opt to surrender its licence if it is no longer involved in the provisioning of nonuniversal service licence activity. 4.6 The licensee is required to submit by way of a written notice, the intent to surrender its licence, provides the Board of Directors resolution in support of the surrender submission and enclose the original copy of its licence to MCMC. 4.7 The surrender shall take effect on the date MCMC receives the licence and the notice under subsection 201 of the PSA 2012, or where a later date is specified in the notice, on that date. 4.8 The surrender of the licence shall be irrevocable unless the licensee has expressed it to take effect on a later date and before that date, MCMC, by notice in writing to the licensee, allows the surrender to be withdrawn. 4.9 Where the effective date of surrender is specified in the notice, the date of the surrender submission or the date of the Board of Directors resolution appended does not carry any weightage on the effective date of the surrender of the licence. 4.10 It is prudent for a licensee which is unable to meet its obligation, or no longer undertaking the licensable activities to consider the option of surrendering its licence to MCMC before its anniversary date, as this reflects responsible behaviour that will be viewed favourably by MCMC.
